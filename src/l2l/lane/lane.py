        """Recursively loads modules and packages from the given import path.

        This method imports all modules and packages within the specified path,
        including nested subpackages. It's typically used to preload all lane
        implementations so they can be discovered by the lane system.

        The method intelligently handles both regular modules and packages with
        __init__.py files, and it skips special folders (those with names like
        __pycache__).

        Args:
            path: The import path to load from (e.g., "myproject.lanes").
                 This should be a Python import path, not a file path.

        Yields:
            module: Each imported module object.

        Example:
            ```python
            # Load all modules in the 'myproject.lanes' package
            for module in Lane.load("myproject.lanes"):
                print(f"Loaded module: {module.__name__}")
            ```

        Note:
            This method is often called during application startup to ensure all
            lane classes are loaded and registered with the lane system.
